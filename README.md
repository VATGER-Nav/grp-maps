NOTAM updates for Ground Radar Plugin

Within a folder for your Regionalgroup or Flightinformationregion place the GRpluginMaps.txt
Configure RG Bremen PlugIn.json to point "grpluginNotamUrl" to your file.

If the locally available file and the one listed here differ the user will be displayed a warning and the "NOTAM" version from this repository will be downloaded.

This way we can have updated NOTAMS without having to relase Update or Full GNG packages.
